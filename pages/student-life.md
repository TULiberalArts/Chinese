With more than 1.3 billion residents, China is a world unto itself. And with more than 40,000 students, so is Temple University! Students in our Chinese program shouldn’t limit themselves to just classroom learning. Give our Confucius Institute a visit or learn directly from the source by [studying abroad](#study-abroad-programs) in China.

## Study Abroad Programs
We strongly encourage all students in the program to spend a summer, semester, or an entire academic year in China. There are many study-abroad opportunities to choose from. Some are tailored to specific academic programs. Others are designed for students in general. Over the years, Temple students have participated in programs in a number of Chinese cities—including Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Taipei. For information on studying abroad, contact the [Office of Education Abroad and Overseas Campuses](https://studyabroad.temple.edu/).
