With more than 1.3 billion residents, China is a world unto itself. And with more than 40,000 students, so is Temple University! Students in our Chinese program shouldn’t limit themselves to just classroom learning. Give our Confucius Institute a visit or learn directly from the source by [studying abroad](#study-abroad-programs) in China.

## Study Abroad Programs
The program strongly encourages all students interested in studying Chinese to spend a summer, semester or an entire academic year studying the language in China. There is a wide variety of study abroad opportunities open to undergraduates. Some are tailored to the interests of specific academic programs. Others are designed for students in general. Over the years, students have participated in programs in a number of Chinese cities including Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai and Taipei. Anyone interested in finding out how to make the necessary arrangements to study abroad should contact the [International Programs Office](https://studyabroad.temple.edu/). Students interested in discussing some of the programs open to them in China should feel free to contact the Chinese Program.

Temple University offers free tutoring sessions for Chinese language courses and opportunities to practice language skills in a relaxed environment. Visit the [Confucius Institute](http://noncredit.temple.edu/confucius) to discover more.
